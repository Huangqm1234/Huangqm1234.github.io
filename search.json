Run linear regression with Ztrain to obtain β^(Ztrain).\nLtrain=L(β^(Ztrain);Ztrain)Ltest=L(β^(Ztrain);Ztest)For overfitting: Ltrain is small and Ltest is large. For underfitting, they both are pretty large.\nThe reason why it was okay to just randomly sample Ztrain and Ztest from the same Z is Independent and Identically Distributed(i.i.d). That is a strong assumption.\nBias and Variance: way to assess overfitting and underfitting\nConsider you have k training datasets drawn from the same i.i.d over the data, and each time fit your model {fβ^1:k} to it. That is to say, you have k different functions.\n\n\nVariance: how much do those fitted functions differ amongst each other, on average?\n\n\nBias: how much does the average of all those fitted functions deviate from the “true” function over the data distribution?\n\n\n.omjwrwylxooi{zoom:80%;}\nupper right means overfitting, left lower means underfitting\nThat also can be applied to the real functions.\n.wqattfjgvwmj{zoom:80%;}\nLow Variance means model is not sensitive to noises. Then, this model is good for fewer/worse data. Low Bias means model has a high capacity. Then, this model is good for more/better data.\nEffective Bias/Variance Under Varying Dataset Sizes\nWhen the training dataset becomes larger, what will happen to Bias and Variance?\n\n\nBias: Bias will not be impacted by the size of trainning dataset. The essence of bias lies in the limitations of the expression in the hypothesis space. Increasing the amount of data can make the model get closer to the optimal model within  the hypothesis space, but it can not break through the limitation of the space.\n\n\nVariance: Variance will be lower. Increasing data will provide a stronger control to the functions.\n\n\nWhen expanding the hypothesis class (similar to adding more dimensions to the features), what will happen to Bias and Variance?\n\n\nBias: Expanding the hypothesis class means the model has higher capacity. That is to say, Bias will be lower.\n\n\nVariance: Bias being lower means Variance being higher.\n\n\nRegularization: way to fix underfitting and overfitting\n\n\nSolutions to fix underfitting and overfitting\n\nImprove the trainning dataset -&gt; collect more data.\nChoose the right model family -&gt; not too simple, not too complex.\nChoose the right loss function -&gt; MSE + a term which can control the fit complexity.\n\n\n\nLinear regression with L2 regularization:\nL(β;Z)=1n∑i=1n(yi−βTxi)2+λ∥β∥22=1n∑i=1n(yi−βTxi)2+λ∑j=1dβj2λ is a hyperparameter, λ&gt;=0, and λ should between [10−3,103]\nIf using intercept term ϕ(x)=[1,x1,…,xn]T, no penalty on the bias parameter β1=1:\nL(β;Z)==1n∑i=1n(yi−βTxi)2+λ∑j=2dβj2sum from j=2\nskipping the penalty on the bias term ensures regularization focuses on taming feature-related complexity (to prevent overfitting) without harming the model’s ability to fit the data’s overall trend (to prevent underfitting).\nIntuition on L2 Regularization\nConsider a feature map with d=10 features [x1,...,xd]. Suppose during linear regression we forced βj=0 for all j&gt;5. This is exactly equal to choosing a smaller-capacity hypothesis class, induced by the smaller feature maps with d=5.\nThus a large λ will pull coefficients towards 0, which let the function have a low capacity.\n.pgrluverfnbg{zoom:80%;}\nL2 regularized regression amounts to preferring smaller weights according to Gaussian Probability Density Function (Gaussian pdf).\n.neeoymxvzevy{zoom:80%;}\nWhen the λ becomes larger, the plot of Gaussian pdf becomes much slimmer.\n\nAt the “full loss” point, the “pull force of the fitted data” and the “pull force of the simplified weights” counterbalance each other, achieving stability. When λ becomes larger, the “pull force of the simplified weights” becomes larger.\n\nℹ️ Note\nFor the new parameter βnew∗=minβLnew(β;Z) (Lnew(β;Z)=L(β;Z)+λR(β)), their corresponding value of L(β;Z) would be larger than before regularization.\nSince, L(β;Z) before regularization is the smallest. βnew∗ will let model be more generalize. Thus, L(βnew∗;Z) will be larger than L(βold∗;Z) (βold∗=minβLold(β;Z), Lold(β;Z)=L(β;Z)).\n\nCross-Validation for Hyperparameter Tuning / Model Selection\nHyperparameter Tuning\nNaive strategy to select λ is by trying a few different candidates λi and choose the one that minimizes the test loss. It often make sense to sample uniformly in log-space e.g. 10−3,10−2,10−1,1,101,102,103.\nBut if we directly tune λ on test dataset, it will contaminate the test dataset. Because test set MSE is meant to be an unbiased noisy estimate of true generalization MSE. But tuning λ on test set leaks test set info into model. Test set error gets biased to be lower than true generalization error.\n.nwinnvuidiro{zoom:67%;}\noverfitting of hyperparameters on test set\nValidation Set\nThe solution for the problem above is Validation set.\n\n\nNow, the dataset is split into three parts:\n\nTraining set: used to find the optimal parameters.\nValidation set: used to find the optimal λ.\nTesting set: used to get the generalization ability of the model.\n\n\n\nCross Validation\n\n\nBasic algorithm\n\nSplit Z into Ztrian, Zval and Ztest.\nFor t∈{1,…,h} hyperparameter choices:\n\nRun linear regression with Ztrain and λt to obtain β^(Ztrain,λt).\nEvaluate validation loss Lvalt=L(β^(Ztrain,λt),Zval)\n\n\nGet the best λt\n\nChoose t′=arg⁡mintLvalt with lowest validation loss.\nRe-run linear regression with Ztrain (actually, this Ztrain is not similar with the above Ztrain, this Ztrain means Ztrain+Zvali) and λt′ to obtain β^(Ztrain,λt).\n\n\n\n\n\nk-fold algorithm (Z is small)\n.qmhpjxngrlxb{zoom:80%;}\nAssuming k=3, with each λt, we can get the validation loss on each Zval.

Then, every neuron computes the same output for any input X: zi=Wi∗X+bi=0∗X+0=0 (for all neurons i).\nIn the forward propagation, because each neuron has same weights and bias, they produce same output. In the backward propagation, because the gradient for each neurons depends only on its output and upstream gradient from the next layer, their gradients are also identical.\nIn the parameter update, since gradients are all identical and Wold=0, Wnew remains identical across neurons.\nIt is equivalent to just having 1 unit per layer → Symmetry (must be broken!)\n\n\nKaiming Initialization\nDesigned for ReLU.\nWeights are initialized from a normal distribution $W_\\mathrm{layer}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\frac{2}{D_\\mathrm{in}}\\right) $, where $D_{in} = $ number of inputs to the layer.\n\n\nXavier Initialization\nDesigned for tanh.\nWeights are initialized from a normal distribution Wlayer∼N(0,1Din+Dout), where Din = inputs to the layer, Dout = output to the layer.\n\n\nBias Initialization\nInitialize the biases to be all zeros.\n\n\n\nℹ️ Note\nRecommend Kaiming or Xavier\n\nBatch Normalization\nCovariate shift: As layers 1,2,…,l-1 learn, the distribution of inputs to layer l are shifting.\nObviously, covariant shift slows down learning.\nTo solve this problem, we should standardize the activations of each layer, so that they are always in N(0,1).\nStandardization is differentiable. So gradient descent still works.\nWe can compute mean and std (standard deviation) over mini-batch.\nBatch Normalization can be applied before or after activation layer. (i.e., RuLU(BN(Wx)) or BN(RuLU(Wx))).\n\nℹ️ Note\nRecommend BN after activation → BN(RuLU(Wx))\n\nRegularization\n\n\nL2 regularization\nAdd λ2∥W∥22 to loss function. It is equivalent to decay weight at every update W=W−λW. (so, it is also called weight decay)\n\n\nL1 regularization\nAdd λ|W| to loss fucntion.\n\n\n\n⚠️ Warning\nDo Not regularize bias term\n\n\nℹ️ Note\nRecommend L2 + Dropout\n\nDropout\nRandomly drop a fraction p (usually 0.5) of the units in a layer.\nThere are three intuitions that can help to explain why does dropout work?\n\n\nIntuition 1: Noise-robustness to missing information.\nDuring training, Dropout randomly “drops out” (disables) some neurons’ outputs. This forces the network to learn to make predictions even when part of the input information is missing.\nJust as humans can recognize objects even if parts are obscured (e.g., a partially hidden cat), the network becomes robust to noise or incomplete inputs — it doesn’t rely on any single neuron or feature to make decisions.\n\n\nIntuition 2: Units must work with diverse co-units (leading to disentangled features).\nDropout’s randomness means a neuron never relies on specific partner neurons (since those partners might be dropped out in any iteration).\nThis forces each neuron to learn features that work with many different sets of “companion” neurons (instead of relying on a fixed group).\n\n\nIntuition 3: Training a “random subset” of networks (implicit ensemble learning)\nWhen Dropout is applied to a layer with N neurons, each training iteration effectively trains a slightly different subnetwork — chosen randomly from 2N possible subnetworks (since each neuron has two states: “active” or “dropped out”).\nFor example, a layer with 100 neurons has 2100possible subnetworks — a huge number. Most subnetworks are never trained in full, and each subnetwork only gets one update per appearance.\nHowever, all these subnetworks share weights: Updating weights for one subnetwork indirectly updates weights for all subnetworks that share those weights.\nThis mirrors ensemble learning (e.g., bagging): Instead of training one large model, Dropout trains thousands of tiny subnetworks, and testing (with all neurons active) acts like an “ensemble” of these subnetworks — improving generalization.\n\n\nDuring the training, we can turn on the dropout to improve the generalization. But, in the testing, we should turn off the dropout. However, now, the output strength of each neuron is twice of what it is in training (consider p = 0.5. In the training, each neuron has 50% contribution to the output. But, in the testing, because the dropout is switched off, each neuron has 100% contribution to the output.).\nThus, we should divide outgoing weights by 2 (or 1/dropout). This approximates the “average” prediction of all possible sub-models created during training.\nManaging Training\nMonitor your validation losses, and stop training your network when they start rising. Can be thought of as a simple and really efficient way to introduce regularization.\nData Augmentation\nIt is often used when you know that your output is robust to some transformations of your data.\nFor the pictures, you can rotate, shift, flip, crop and combine them. For the language, you can substitute synonyms.\nHyperparameter Optimization\n\n\nKeep the number of hyperparameters as small as possible.\nIf your computation budget lets you optimize only one hyperparameter, let it be the learning rate.\n\n\nParallelize search across many machines.\n\n\nRecord hyperparameters of all runs carefully.\n\n\nUse the same random init for all hyperparameters.\nThat means initializing the weight of the model with same random seed when testing different combinations of hyperparameters, because the randomness of weight may affect the result.\n\n\nFor 2 or 3 hyperparameters, do a systematic “grid search”\n.ycffbsqqsyqn{zoom:50%;}\n\n\n\nℹ️ Note\nFor high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces (&gt;3 hyperparameters), random search is more efficient than grid search. It finds better models with fewer training runs by focusing  on impactful hyperparameters.\n.fmvxnyvfqvtn{zoom:50%;}\n\nCoarse-to-fine Search\n\n\nFirst, search over a large (coarse) range of hyperparameters to identify a “promising region” with good performance.\n\n\nThen, narrow the search window (to a finer scale) around this promising region and repeat — refining the search to find the exact optimal hyperparameters.\n\n\nIf best results are not at the boundaries of the current window,\ncenter a smaller window on the best hyperparameters found so far, and repeat the search (to refine the search in this more focused region).\nIf best results are near the boundaries of the current window,\nshift the window to center on the best hyperparameters, then repeat (to ensure the optimal value isn’t “cut off” by the window’s edge).\nThere also an advanced tip: Bayesian Optimization.

组在实验中的表现并无显著差异。在样本辨别实验中，两组在短时长（40、91ms）时，样本辨别表现均优于纹理辨别；在长时长（478、1093、2500ms）时，纹理辨别表现均更优。这一结果有力地证明了听觉统计处理的发展并不依赖于早期视觉经验。\n\n\nFunctional interplay between selective auditory computations and

Note\nPython中万物皆是对象\n\n可变类型与不可变类型\n\n\n可变类型：在函数参数传递时，类似于引用。如字典、列表、集和。\n\n\n不可变类型：在函数参数传递时，类似于值传递。如整数、字符串、元素。\n\n\n可以使用.copy()来实现对于 可变对象 的复制，而不要使用=。=会使连个变量指向同一个可变类型对象的地址\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]list2 = list1.copy()list3 = list1 list1.append(4)print(list1, f&quot;地址为&#123;id(list1)&#125;&quot;)print(list2, f&quot;地址为&#123;id(list2)&#125;&quot;)print(list3, f&quot;地址为&#123;id(list3)&#125;&quot;)\n输出：\n[1, 2, 3, 4] 地址为2227037551360[1, 2, 3] 地址为2227037228800[1, 2, 3, 4] 地址为2227037551360\n但是.copy()本质上还是浅拷贝，当对象中含有指针时，浅拷贝就会产生风险。这时就需要使用深拷贝.deepcopy()。.deepcopy()是依赖于copy()库的。\nimport copyoriginal = [1,2,3, [4, 5]] # [4, 5]本质保存的是指向其的指针list_copy = original.copy() # 浅拷贝list_deepcopy = copy.deepcopy(original) # 深拷贝original[3].append(6) # 修改原列表中的嵌套列表print(f&quot;original = &#123;original&#125;&quot;)print(f&quot;list_copy = &#123;list_copy&#125;&quot;)print(f&quot;list_deepcopy = &#123;list_deepcopy&#125;&quot;)\n输出：\noriginal = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]list_copy = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]list_deepcopy = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]\n假设original指向了 [1,2,3,指针1] ，由于list_copy是浅拷贝而来的，所以其指向的是另一个内存单元的[1,2,3,指针1]。而因为list_deepcopy是深拷贝而来，所以其对列表内部的元素不仅仅是简单的复制值，但遇到指针时，其会开辟一个新的内存单元，然后指向新的内存单元。如下图所示。\n.yvrnkrzjukuw{zoom:60%;}\n所以当original中指针1所示指向的空间中的内容被修改后，list_copy中指针1所指向的空间中的内容同样被修改，其二者指向的是同一个内存空间。\n需要注意到是，这张图中只是展示概念。真正的数组保存不可能是一个内存单元存下了所有内容，而是开辟一段连续的内存空间保存这些值，original则指向了这段连续的内存空间的起始地址。\n函数\n:::

 try:\t可能错误的代码except:\t如果出现异常执行的代码\n案例：\n  try:\tf = open(&quot;text.txt&quot;,&#x27;r&#x27;)except:    print(&quot;出现了异常，使用新的方案&quot;)\tf = open(&quot;linux.txt&quot;,&#x27;w&#x27;)\n当try语句中出现异常后，程序不会抛出异常，而是使用except来让程序继续运行\n捕获指定的异常\n基本语法：\ntry:\t可能错误的代码except 指定的异常 as 异常的别名:\t如果出现异常执行的代码\n案例：\ntry:    print(name) # 注意，前文并没有定义nameexcept NameError as e:     print(&quot;name未定义&quot;)    print(e) # 把异常打印出来\n结果：\n.axlxiaooobno{zoom:80%;}\n捕获多个异常\n基本语法：\ntry:    可能错误的代码except (异常1, 异常2): # 也可以：except (异常1, 异常2) as e\t如果出现异常执行的代码\n捕获所有异常\n最简单的try   except语句就可以捕获所有异常了，但是没法对所捕获到的异常进行输出。\n基本语法：\ntry:    可能错误的代码except Exception as 异常的别名: # Exception可以被认为是所有异常的父类    如果出现异常执行的代码\n通过输出异常的别名就可以看到捕获的异常是什么。\nelse 与 finally\nelse用于表示在没有异常的时候该执行什么行为。\n基本语法：\ntry:    可能错误的代码except Exception as 异常的别名:    如果出现异常执行的代码else:    没有异常时执行的代码finally:    有没有异常都执行的代码\n::: tips\n提示\nfinally中一般都是用来执行资源关闭操作，比如文件的关闭\n:::\n案例：\ntry:    print(&quot;正常执行&quot;)except Exception as e:    print(e)else:    print(&quot;没有异常&quot;)\n输出：\n.nqokvvonxesg{zoom:67%;}\n异常的传递\n假设有函数调用关系如下\nmain()|--func01()   |--func02()\n当func02()的代码中出现异常后，异常会向上逐级传递（从func02() -&gt; func01() -&gt; main() ），这条传递线上的任意一个函数有对异常的捕获都将使程序可以继续执行。\n抛出异常\n使用raise可以抛出一个我们想要的异常。\n基础语法：\nraise 异常\n抛出的异常一定要是异常的实例或者使异常的类，即Exception的子类。例如可以是NameError('that is a name error')。因为NameError是Exception的一个子类，所以这里创建了一个异常的匿名对象。\n举例：\nx = 4if x &lt; 5:    raise Exception(&quot;x小于5&quot;)\n输出：\n  File &quot;c:/Users/QianmingHuang/Desktop/Python-Learning/异常.py&quot;, line 32, in raise_func    raise Exception(&quot;x小于5&quot;)Exception: x小于5\n自定义的异常\n用户需要创建一个继承了Exception类的类。\n::: tips\n提示\n有时候需要给一个模块写若干个自定义的异常\n:::\n举例：\nclass ExamError(Exception):    &quot;&quot;&quot;基于考试的自定义异常类&quot;&quot;&quot;    passclass SubmissionError(ExamError):    &quot;&quot;&quot;提交时发生的错误&quot;&quot;&quot;    def __init__(self, message=&quot;Cannot submit after the exam has ended&quot;):        self.message = message        super().__init__(self.message)def submit_exam(student, answers, exam_end_time):    from datetime import datetime    current_time = datetime.now()    if current_time &gt; exam_end_time:        raise SubmissionError(&quot;You cannot submit the exam after the deadline.&quot;)    else:        # 处理提交逻辑        print(&quot;Exam submitted successfully!&quot;)# 假设考试结束时间是之前的某个时间from datetime import datetime, timedeltaexam_end_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=1)try:    submit_exam(&quot;John Doe&quot;, [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;], exam_end_time)except SubmissionError as e:    print(f&quot;Submission failed: &#123;e&#125;&quot;)\n输出结果：\nSubmission failed: You cannot submit the exam after the deadline.\n在上面这个案例中就展示了自定义异常的一个场景。对于提交的异常可以专门写一个类SubmissionError，对于别的异常，比如答题中的异常，也可以专门写一个类来应对。\n面向对象\n类\n变量名 = 类名() # 类的实例化\n类名()创建出了一个匿名对象，变量名也是一个对象，其指向了这个匿名对象。更确切的说，变量名是通过类名()创建出的匿名对象的引用。\n对于每一个对象来说，其都拥有自己的内存空间，保存着自己的属性。但是来自同一个类的不同对象共享类的方法，也就是说类的方法在内存中只有一份，在使用类的方法时，要把对象的引用（可以理解为当前调用此方法的实例的地址，类比C++中的this指针）传递到方法内部。\n在python中有两种类。分别是新式类和旧式类，主要区别是新式类继承自object类，而旧式类不是。自python3开始，一切的类都是新式类\n\n\n__del__方法\n如果说__init__方法类比于 C++ 的构造函数，那么__del__方法就可以类比于 C++ 的析构函数。\n\n\n__str__方法\n此方法的作用是咱输出对象变量的时候，可以输出自定义的内容。\nclass 类名1：    def __str__(self):    \treturn 想输出的字符串对象变量名1 = 类名1()print(对象变量名1)\n\n注意\n__str__方法的返回值必须是 字符串\n\n\n\n私有属性和私有方法\n\n\n定义方法：\n在属性或者方法前面加上两个下划线\nclass Women:    def __init__(self, name):        self.name = name        self.__age = 18  # 私有属性，外部不可访问            def __secret(self):  # 私有方法，外部可不访问        print(&quot;%s 的年龄是 %d&quot; % (self.name, self.__age))\n\n\npython中没有真正意义上的私有\n\n\n在给属性、方法命名是，实际上是对名称作了一些特殊处理，使外界无法访问到\n\n\n通过_类名__私有方法\\属性可以访问私有方法和属性\nxiaohong = Women(&quot;xiaohong&quot;)xiaohong._Women__secret() # 此时就可以访问私有方法啦\n\n\n\n\n类也是对象\n开篇第一句话是：python中万物皆为对象。类也不意外，可以把其看做类对象。\n类对象在内存中只有一个，一个类对象可以创建多个实例。\n正因为类是一个对象，所以其拥有自己的 类属性 和 类方法。二者都可以通过类名·的方式来访问\n\n\n类属性\n仅仅用于记录类的特征，无法用于记录实例特征。\nclass Counter:    # 类属性：用于统计实例数量    instance_count = 0    def __init__(self):        Counter.instance_count += 1 # 通过 类名.类属性 的方式调用\n也可以使用实例.类属性的方式调用类属性（向上查找机制），但是十分不推荐。比如 实例.类属性 = 1 的时候，实际上是给实例增加了一个属性，而不是对类属性的值进行了修改。\n\n\n类方法\n类方法需要用到修饰器@classmethod，其只能访问 类属性 和 类方法。\nclass ParentClass:    class_variable = &quot;这是父类的类变量&quot;    @classmethod # 必须要有@classmethod修饰    def class_method(cls): # 类方法的第一个参数必须是cls        return f&quot;调用了 &#123;cls.__name__&#125; 的类方法，类变量值为: &#123;cls.class_variable&#125;&quot;class ChildClass(ParentClass):    class_variable = &quot;这是子类的类变量&quot;# 子类调用父类的类方法result = ChildClass.class_method()print(result)\n输出：\n调用了 ChildClass 的类方法，类变量值为: 这是子类的类变量\n因为cls的存在，类方法知道其是被哪个类对象调用的。当ChildClass类调用了类方法class_method()后，cls收到了ChildClass类的引用（可以理解为cls此时成为了ChildClass），也就调用了ChildClass的类属性。\nclass Student:    def __init__(self, name, age):        self.name = name        self.age = age    @classmethod    def from_string(cls, info):        name, age = info.split(&#x27; &#x27;)        return cls(name, age)  # 此处等价于Student(name, age)，因为cls指向Student类s1 = Student(&quot;小明&quot;, 10)s2 = Student(&quot;小李&quot;, 20)s3 = Student.from_string(&quot;小红 14&quot;)  # 调用类方法处理特殊输入for s in [s1, s2, s3]:    print(f&quot;s.name = &#123;s.name&#125;, s.age = &#123;s.age&#125;&quot;)\n输出：\ns.name = 小明, s.age = 10s.name = 小李, s.age = 20s.name = 小红, s.age = 14\n\n\n静态方法\n静态方法需要用到修饰器@staticmethod。其既不需要cls也不需要self作为输入，好似独立于类而存在。但是其依旧可以用类名.的方式来访问。\nclass MathUtils:    @staticmethod    def add(a, b):        return a + b# 调用静态方法result = MathUtils.add(3, 5)print(f&quot;3 和 5 相加的结果是: &#123;result&#125;&quot;)print(id(MathUtils))print(id(MathUtils.add))\n输出：\n3 和 5 相加的结果是: 821535934431682153611265360\n可以发现，静态方法并不保存在类对象中。\n嵌套类\n类中是可以再定义类的。\nclass A:    class B:        pass\n这等价于下面的写法：\nclass B:    passclass A:    b = B()\n这就是说类B的实例b是类A的类方法\n继承\n除了继承父类的属性和方法外，还可以对父类的方法进行重写。重写可以分为两种方式。\n\n\n覆盖：在子类中定义了一个和父类同名的方法并且实现。\n\n\n扩展：在子类中定义了一个和父类同名的方法，在其中使用了父类同名的方法。这时就需要super类出场了。\n通过super()的方式生成一个匿名对象，其会按照__mro__属性的顺序来访问父类。\nclass A:    def method(self):        print(&quot;A 的方法&quot;)class B(A):    def method(self):        print(&quot;B 的方法&quot;)        super().method()class C(A):    def method(self):        print(&quot;C 的方法&quot;)        super().method()class D(B, C):    def method(self):        print(&quot;D 的方法&quot;)        super().method()d = D()d.method()print(D.__mro__)\n输出：\nD 的方法B 的方法C 的方法A 的方法(&lt;class &#x27;__main__.D&#x27;&gt;, &lt;class &#x27;__main__.B&#x27;&gt;, &lt;class &#x27;__main__.C&#x27;&gt;, &lt;class &#x27;__main__.A&#x27;&gt;, &lt;class &#x27;object&#x27;&gt;)\n可以看出，父类方法调用的顺序就是__mro__中设置的顺序。因此，__mro__将会帮助用户来解决来自不同父类的同名函数的调用问题。\n::: danger\n警告\n但是，最好不要通俗的认为super()就是一个父类对象。可以具体看后面的这两组实验。\n:::\nclass ParentClass:    @classmethod    def class_method(cls):        print(f&quot;调用了 &#123;cls.__name__&#125; 的类方法&quot;)        print(id(cls))class ChildClass(ParentClass):    @classmethod    def class_method(cls):        print(f&quot;调用了 &#123;cls.__name__&#125; 的类方法，现在要调用父类的类方法&quot;)        print(id(cls))        super().class_method()# 调用子类的类方法ChildClass.class_method()\n输出：\n调用了 ChildClass 的类方法，现在要调用父类的类方法2153593471488调用了 ChildClass 的类方法2153593471488\n现在，只将super()改成ParentClass，即父类类名。\nclass ParentClass:    @classmethod    def class_method(cls):        print(f&quot;调用了 &#123;cls.__name__&#125; 的类方法&quot;)        print(id(cls))class ChildClass(ParentClass):    @classmethod    def class_method(cls):        print(f&quot;调用了 &#123;cls.__name__&#125; 的类方法，现在要调用父类的类方法&quot;)        print(id(cls))        ParentClass.class_method() # 此处做出了修改！# 调用子类的类方法ChildClass.class_method()\n输出：\n调用了 ChildClass 的类方法，现在要调用父类的类方法2153593459216调用了 ParentClass 的类方法2153593465824\n可以看出，此时的cls的地址是不一样的。而使用super()的时候，cls的地址则是相同的。\n\n\n多态\n在C++中，多态的实现是通过父类指针或引用指向子类对象实现的。而python中也是如此，只不过因为python中没有指针的显式概念，所以可以进一步理解为：不同的子类对象调用同名的父类方法，产生不同的执行结果。\n# 定义一个基类class Animal:    def speak(self):        pass# 定义 Dog 类，继承自 Animal 类class Dog(Animal):    def speak(self):        return &quot;汪汪汪！&quot;# 定义 Cat 类，继承自 Animal 类class Cat(Animal):    def speak(self):        return &quot;喵喵喵！&quot;# 定义一个函数，接收一个 Animal 类型的对象def animal_speak(animal):    print(animal.speak())# 创建 Dog 和 Cat 的实例dog = Dog()cat = Cat()# 调用 animal_speak 函数，传入不同的对象animal_speak(dog)animal_speak(cat)\n输出：\n汪汪汪！喵喵喵！\n多线程\n每个线程都有属于其自己的一组CPU寄存器（比如指令指针和堆栈指针寄存器），这组CPU寄存器被称为“线程的上下文”。线程的上下文可以被想象为一个线程的“个人信息包”，它包含了线程运行时需要的各种状态信息。\n当线程被调度执行时，CPU 会根据该线程的上下文信息来设置 CPU 寄存器的状态，使其恢复到上次该线程运行时的状态。这样，线程就可以从上次停止的地方继续执行下去。比如，线程在执行一个复杂的数学计算，由于某种原因（如时间片用完）暂停了执行，当时 CPU 寄存器中保存了计算的中间结果和指令指针等信息。当该线程再次被调度执行时，通过其上下文恢复 CPU 寄存器的状态，就能够继续进行之前未完成的计算，而不会丢失之前的工作进度。\n\n注意\n多线程是宏观上的并行，微观上的并发。\n\n线程是可以被中断的。当别的线程正在运行时，线程可以暂时进入睡眠状态，即线程的退让。\n同一个进程下的多个线程是共享内存空间的。\n\n\n线程可以被分为两种：\n\n内核线程：操作系统内核进行管理\n用户线程：用户在程序中管理\n\n\n\nthreading模块\nthreading模块中的Thread类就是用于初始化线程的。可以通过其直接生成一个线程示例。\nimport

languages","Python"],"tags":["Python"]},{"title":"What is a standard CPP","url":"/2025/10/06/What-is-a-standard-CPP/","content":"From this Blog, I will start writing blogs in English. Since this is my first attempt to write English version blogs and I am not a native speaker of English, there might be some issues with grammar, spelling, or the naturalness of expression. If you ever find anything unclear or awkward, I sincerely apologize and I would really appreciate it if you could tell me the problem by email (brad_huang@outlook.com). Thank you for your understanding and support! Let us get start!\n\nLet us take a look of a piece of code:\n#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123;    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;    return 0;&#125;\nAt first glance, how many problems — that is , instance of nonstandard code — can you find? Well, except for int main() , which is standard, everything else is nonstandard. Let me explain it step by step.\nFirstly, the first line #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; is a universal header. but it is not part of the C++ standard library. Many compilers don’t support it (except gcc). Moreover, it may cause serious naming conflicts and introduce a large number of macros, both of which may lead to unexpected erros — a real disaster for a big project with thousands of lines of code. In addition, this nonstandard header may increase the time spent for compiling. In short,  avoid using bits/stdc++.h !\nSecondly, using namespace std should not be used here at all, because it may cause undesirable name collision. For example, if you define your own class string and include using namespace std, the compiler will be confused when it encounters string.

Inference）\n参数估计\n\n\n机器学习的本质：从已有数据中估计出参数\n\n求解过程：最优化理论\n\n\n\n两个学派：\n\n\n第一个学派（频率学派）认为，数据就是客观存在的，不受任何影响，所以直接求p(x|z)，即先验概率（在给定参数z的前提下，数据为x的概率）。\n频率学派重点关注基于已有数据对总体参数进行估计。比如估计一枚硬币正面朝上的概率，通过大量抛硬币试验，用正面朝上的频率近似这个概率，不考虑其他潜在 “隐变量” 。他们认为存在一个真实固定的参数值，通过足够多数据和合适统计方法就能逼近这个真值。\n常用方法有最大似然估计(MLE)（L(θ|x)=P(X=x|θ)）。最大似然估计根据样本构造似然函数，找到使似然函数最大的参数值，认为这就是对总体真实参数的最佳估计，强调数据本身对参数估计的作用，不依赖先验信息。\n\n\n第二个学派（贝叶斯学派）认为，观测到的数据x会受到隐变量z的影响，所以他们求的是后验概率p(z|x)。\n.vkmvefivlvkb{zoom:50%;}\n基于贝叶斯定理，后验概率p(θ|x)可以表示为p(θ|x)=p(x|θ)p(θ)p(x)，其中θ是待估计的参数，x是观测数据。p(x|θ)是似然函数，表示在给定参数θ下观测到数据x的概率；p(θ)是先验概率，反映了在观测数据之前对参数θ的认知；p(x)是证据因子，通常作为归一化常数.\n最大后验估计就是找到使后验概率p(θ|x)最大的参数θ值，即θ^MAP=arg⁡maxθp(θ|x)=arg⁡maxθp(x|θ)p(θ)p(x)。由于p(x)与θ无关，所以等价于θ^MAP=arg⁡maxθp(x|θ)p(θ)。\n与最大似然估计的比较 ：\n\n\n最大似然估计：只考虑似然函数p(x|θ)，通过找到使p(x|θ)最大的θ值来估计参数，没有利用先验信息。当数据量足够大时，最大似然估计能得到较好的结果，但在数据量较少时，可能会出现过拟合或不合理的估计。\n\n\n最大后验估计：综合了似然函数和先验概率，在数据量较少时，先验信息可以起到正则化的作用，帮助避免过拟合，得到更符合实际情况的估计结果。例如，在估计一个硬币正面朝上的概率时，如果没有先验信息，最大似然估计可能会根据少量的投掷结果给出一个极端的估计值。但如果有一个合理的先验，如认为硬币大致是均匀的，那么最大后验估计会在似然函数和先验之间进行平衡，得到一个更合理的估计。\n\n\n::: success\n思考\n感觉贝叶斯学派更屌一些？毕竟人家是直接从当前的数据中直接推算出来了针对当前数据的一组参数。\n:::\n\n\n\n\n通过两个学派的讲解，其实对当前的深度学习可以进行一个分类。对于传统的深度神经网络（如CNN、RNN等）或者称判别式模型，都是基于频率学派的。其是通过最优化理论找到一组参数来尽可能使结果逼近真值。而概率生成模型，都是基于贝叶斯学派的。\n求解最大后验估计\np(z|x)=p(x|z)p(z)p(x)=p(x|z)p(z)∫p(z)p(x|z)dz其中p(x|z)是似然函数(likelihood)，p(z)是先验(prior)，p(x)是evidence。evidence使用积分来求解，但是其很多时候都是一个不可积的积分，无法获得解析解。这时候可以使用马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛方法（MCMC）来取样，近似的求解p(z|x)。\n但是MCMC方法计算较慢，变分推断更适合求解大规模推断，适合并行计算。\n变分推断的算法思路\n\n图中黄色的部分就是要求的目标分布（p(z|x;ϕ)，φ是参数）,红色的曲线q(z;θ)（可以是一个已知的高斯分布，θ是参数）是用来近似目标分布的。现在只需要移动曲线q，使其尽可能多的与黄色部分重叠。绿色曲线代表了最后重叠最大的位置。\n上面的描述是定性的，用定量的数学语言来描述就是最小化两个分布之间的KL散度，具体公式如下：\nminθKL(q(z;θ)||p(z|x;ϕ))目标就是求出一个参数θ ，也就是怎么移动q。\n\n\nKL散度\n\n\n概念：用于衡量两个分布之间的距离，是一种相对熵\n\n\n相对熵 = 交叉熵 - 信息熵\n\n\n\n计算公式：\nKL(q(z;θ)||p(z|x))]=Eq(z;θ)[log⁡q(z;θ)p(z|x)]是针对假定的函数q来求期望。\n\n\n\n\n公式推导\nKL(q(z;θ)||p(z|x))]=Eq[log⁡q(z)p(z|x)]=Eq[log⁡q(z)−log⁡p(z|x)]=Eq[log⁡q(z)−log⁡p(x|z)p(z)p(x)]=Eq[log⁡q(z)]−Eq[log⁡p(x|z)]−Eq[log⁡p(z)]+Eq[log⁡p(x)]=−Eq[log⁡p(x|z)]+KL(q(z)||p(z))+Eq[log⁡p(x)]最后结果里，Eq[log⁡p(x)] 是一个常数（x 是已有的数据，所以 log⁡p(x) 是常数）。前半部分 −Eq[log⁡p(x|z)]+KL(q(z)||p(z)) 为证据下界（Evidence Lower Bound）,缩写为ELBO，那么整个公式可以改写为下面的样子。\nKL(q(z;θ)||p(z|x))]=−Eq[log⁡p(x|z)]+KL(q(z)||p(z))+Eq[log⁡p(x)]=−ELBO+Eq[log⁡p(x)]进一步，最小化KL散度，就是在最大化ELBO。因为Eq[log⁡p(x)]是定值，而ELBO前面又有一个负号。所以式子可进一步改写成下面的样子。\narg⁡minKL(q(z;θ)||p(z|x))]=arg⁡maxELBO=arg⁡maxEq[log⁡p(x|z)]−KL(q(z)||p(z))\n\n案例\n假设我们有若干的数据x（不同颜色的点），我们需要从这些数据中推理出一个参数z，那么就是在求最大后验估计p(z|x)。假设我们有一个高斯混合模型q(z;θ)（灰色阴影），它假设数据是由多个高斯分布（也叫正态分布 ，即形如f(x)=12πσ2e−(x−μ)22σ2 ，其中μ是均值，σ2是方差的分布）混合而成。θ包含了多个高斯分布的参数。\n\n\n可以看到，随着迭代次数的增加，q(z)逐渐可以准确的拟合出不同颜色的点，也就是拟合出了q(z|x)。\n\n\n\n注意\n尽管变分推断（VI）在运行速度上要比MCMC快，但是其需要先对后验分布进行一个假设，即其得到的近似解没有MCMC方法通过采样得到的近似解准确。\n\n变分自编码器（Variational Auto - Encoder，VAE）\n自编码器\n\n输入层（蓝色的x）和输出层(橙色的x^)具有相同的维度。z=e(x)是一个降维后的隐藏层，其维度明显是小于输入层与输出层。\n通过最小化输入数据和解码数据之间的重构误差（loss=||x−x^||2=||x−d(z)||2=||x−d(e(x))||2）来学习参数。\n相比较于PCA，自动编码器因深度神经网络所带来的非线性而具有更强的降维能力。\n::: tips\n提示\nPCA降维后的向量是严格正交的。\n:::\n但是，要注意的一点是，在降维的时候应该尽量确保降维后的数据保存了尽可能多的原始数据信息。自编码器在隐藏层过于小或者编码器过于深的时候可能会导致因降维而丢失大量信息！所以要选择合适深度的编码器与合适尺寸的隐藏层。\n此外，因为自编码器的训练是尽可能减小输入层和输出层之间的误差，所以其并不care降维后的隐藏层（维度对应了潜空间）是否有意义。这将导致从潜空间采样得到的点可能无法对应合理有意义的数据。当训练好后的自编码器用于测试集时，生成的数据可能会毫无意义（可以理解为过拟合于训练数据）。\nVAE基本思想\n此方案引入了正则化来避免过拟合，输入层经过编码后不再是点，而是概率分布。\n\n图中的左列是用AE方案实现的结果，对应了笑的程度。右列是VAE方案的结果，也是对应了笑的程度，但是用概率分布来表达。\n概率生成模型\np(z|x)=p(x|z)p(z)p(x)重温一下贝叶斯公式。AE的方案是在求MLE（最大似然估计）。而VAE方案是在求MAP（最大后验估计）。\n在求p(z|x)最大的时候实际上是在求p(x|z)p(z)最大（因为p(x)与z）无关。所以进一步maxp(z|x)=maxp(x|z)p(z)。为了方便计算，对p(x|z)p(z)取对数，得到ln⁡p(x|z)p(z)=ln⁡p(x|z)+ln⁡p(z)。当p(z)为拉普拉斯分布概率密度函数时，ln⁡p(z)=−ln(2b)−|z|b，此时ln⁡p(z) 等价于引入了一个与|z|相关的项。所以，p(z)可以理解为一个正则项，其用来避免过拟合。\n","categories":["Artificial Intelligence","Deep Learning"],"tags":["Deep Learning"]}]
